Search a database full of information on thousands of movies

## How was this built?

The movie wiki is a React app that uses data from the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/), it's still a WIP though

## Is there a live version I can try out?

Not yet, but soon it'll be available at [https://themovie.wiki](https://themovie.wiki)
