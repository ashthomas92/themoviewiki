# The Movie Wiki

The Movie Wiki allows you to search a database full of information on thousands of movies, series & games.

## How was this built?

It's a React app that uses data from the <a href="https://www.omdbapi.com/" target="_blank">OMDb API</a>. It's still a work in progress at the moment though.

## Is there a live version I can try out?

Not yet, but soon it'll be available at <a href="https://themovie.wiki" target="_blank">https://themovie.wiki</a>

## Why are you making this?

I like movies, I like games, I like the internet, I like development, I like React, I like APIs, I like apps, and I like making stuff... so why not?
