# The Movie Wiki

The Movie Wiki allows you to search a database full of information on thousands of movies, series & games.

## How was this built?

It's a React app that uses data from the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). It's still a work in progress at the moment though.

## Is there a live version I can try out?

Not yet, but soon it'll be available at [https://themovie.wiki](https://themovie.wiki)

## Why are you making this?

I like movies, I like games, I like the internet, I like development, I like React, I like APIs, I like apps, and I like making stuff... so why not?
